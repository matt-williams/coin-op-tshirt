# T-Shirt

This documents the pinout from the Mastercard EL T-Shirt.

Watch out - it uses 100VAC internally!

To turn the T-shirt on programmatically, short the top-left or top-right pins of the toggle switch to ground.  To switch between modes, short the bottom-right pin of the toggle switch to ground for "on" (with manual switching using the pushswitch) and leave floating high for "auto".  Pressing the pushswitch pulls its bottom-right pin to ground.
